# Exclude from smdb loads files containing these strings
# Can find fully qualified file names by grepping, e.g.:
# docker-compose run --rm django locate -d /etc/smdb/SeafloorMapping.db -r '\/ZTopo.grd$' | grep -i ifremer
# >>> Copy this file to your docker_smdb_vol directory that's mounted to /etc/smdb in the django container

# - There are a number of boxes in places we've not worked, like the Indian Ocean, 
#   that contain data Dave received from others as part of MB-System development and
#   trouble-shooting. These are from directories like mbsystem/Data/2008/...IFREMER...
#   that whole "mbsystem" subdirectory does not need to be searched for content.

# - There are other boxes that enclose ship-collected data copied into MappingAUVOps
#   mission planning directories for basemaps upon which AUV surveys were designed
#   (such as in Pescadero Basin, which has data from directories like
#   MappingAUVOps2018/PescaderoBasin/swathdata/surveys/...) Those don't need to be
#   included in the database, but may take specific excluding since they are parallel
#   with our working directories that contain the figures made from the surveys after
#   they've been gridded together.
