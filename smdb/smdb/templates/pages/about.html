    <h2>About the database
        </h2>

        <p>
        The MBARI Seafloor Mapping Database (SMDB) provides access to  
        <a href="https://www.mbari.org/at-sea/vehicles/autonomous-underwater-vehicles/seafloor-mapping-auv/" 
            target="_blank">Mapping AUV</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.mbari.org/technology/ocean-imaging/" target="_blank">
            Low-Altitude Survey System </a> 
            (LASS) data collected by MBARI and our collaborators. 
            It is a relational database with geographic capability, 
            a geo-spatially enabled web query interface on Canyon Head, load scripts for mining data from the 
            SeafloorMapping archive, and eventually, a user interfaces for testing and manually adding data. 
            It is built in Python with Django and PostgreSQL using the PostGIS extension. 
            GitHub is the code repository. The database is in the cloud at Amazon Web Services. 
            The entire software stack is free and open source.
            </p>      
            
            <p>The SMDB is currently in development. 
            If you have suggestions for the SMDB, please contact one of the developers.</p>

     <strong>Motivation
            </strong>    

        <p>MBARI has now conducted hundreds of Mapping AUV missions and dozens of ROV dives with the LASS system. 
        Finalized mapping data are being archived at the 
        <a href="https://www.marine-geo.org/" target="_blank"> Marine Geoscience Data System</a>.  
        In the interim, survey data are stored on the SeafloorMapping share on Titan, where it is accessible to those 
        with intimate knowledge of how the data are organized and how to run the software used for data processing. 
        The data has needed to be more accessible to the operators, engineers, and science teams involved with it, 
        and the mapping products have value to others in the MBARI community as well. 
        The <a href="https://smdb.shore.mbari.org/" target="_blank">SMDB</a> 
        is a new relational database queryable from Canyon Head that is 
        being developed to make the mapping data more accessible within MBARI. </p>

    <strong>Using the database
        </strong> 

        <p>The landing page for the <a href="https://smdb.shore.mbari.org/" target="_blank">SMDB</a> 
        is a zoomable map showing all of the AUV and LASS mission track lines. 
        Mousing over a track line illuminates the track of an individual survey. 
        A time slider and a search box at the top of the page
        allow you to restrict tracks that are shown by time, the survey's mission name or text strings in survey Notes files.
        Click "Update" again to refresh the map.
        </p>
        <p> clicking on a track line and then the thumbnail map that appears, a new page opens 
        showing the path to the survey data, a link to list other missions on that expedition, 
        linked paths to compilations (grids made from the survey), 
        and the contents of the Notes file from that mission. 
        Paths are to directories of the SeafloorMapping share on Titan.
        You must be onsite or VPN'd in with split-tunneling off to see thumbnail images and access the SeafloorMapping share. 
        </p>
        <p> 
        In order to not change the current file-based structure on the SeafloorMapping share on Titan and 
        to minimize impact on the work-flow for processing the sensor data, a load script mines survey data and captures
        metadata in the database. Some conventions that have evolved with our workflow are being exploited, 
        and so need to remain imposed. These are described briefly below and more thoroughly in documentation at GitHub.
        </p>

    <strong>Workflow requirements, in brief
            </strong> 

        <p> 
           The load script searches for directories where there are ZTopo.grd files and assumes these are missions. 
           The directory name where a ZTopo.grd is found becomes the mission name.
           <br>Workflow note: Make a ZTopo.grd in all survey directories. 
           Call your grid something other than ZTopo.grd if it's in a non-survey directory.
        </p>
        <p> 
           A long list of directories to be excluded from this search has been manually created (smdb/exclude.list), 
           to not consider as missions,
           for example, anything in swathdata/surveys/, mission planning directories, mbsystem test data, and more. 
           <br>Workflow note: this exclude.list file needs to be re-evaluated and extended as needed. 
        </p>
        <p> 
           The load script looks for a file named ZTopoSlopeNav.jpg to be used as the thumbnail for the mission.
           <br>Workflow note: Always make a ZTopoSlopeNav.jpg plot in a survey directory. 
           In the plot's title, include the mission name and location (as these can be useful to see in the thumbnail on the map), 
           and whether the mission was a "test" or "failed" 
           (these will be used when the ability to track test or failed missions is implemented).
        </p>
        <p> 
           A file with "Notes.txt" in the filename is sought in the survey directory or 1, 2, or 3 directories above it 
           (often needed for LASS  and Sentry data). 
           Computer IP addresses and passwords are blanked out in the presentation; people's names are not.
           <br>Workflow note: include a *Notes.txt file, and not more than one, in the survey directory or just above. 
        </p>
        <p> 
           The Expedition name is constructed from lines 3 and 4 of the Notes file, 
           where it has evolved that there is often something unique. It truncates at 200 characters.
           <br>Workflow note: Make the contents of those first lines unique 
           enough to distinguish the expedition from other expeditions, but not so unique 
           that it only represents a subset of missions you ran. 
           Make it something useful, for example, 
           For example: ship name, general cruise location, and year.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The first lines until the "-----------" line of the Notes file is being used for populating a comment field
             (not yet implemented).
        </p>
        <p> 
            A mission's track line displayed on the map is obtained from the processed .fbt files. 
            Track length is computed from the track line using a Haversine function.
        </p>
        <p>For the listing of Compilations (figures/projects using a mission's data), 
            directories outside the mission directories are searched for all <gridname>.mb-1 files 
            that include mission name strings. 
            The path and grid names associated with those <gridname>.mb-1 files are listed on the Mission details page. 
            Click on the link for a compilation to open a Compilation page wtih a thumbnail, 
            the grid creation date, command file name, and list of missions called in the <gridname>.mb-1 file. 
            Thumbnails can be JPG, TIFF, or PNG image 
            files, and must include the grid name's exact string as part of their file name to be found. 
            <br>Workflow note: The <gridname>.grd and <gridname>.mb-1 names match by default so that part shouldn't require our diligence. 
            For a thumbnail to be associated, the image name must also match the grid name. 
            Making our geoTiff names match the grid name hasn't been a priority in the past and that doesn't need to change. 
            However, to be helpful for us trying to make sense of what we've done before, or for other MBARIans looking for a map they can use, 
            make a simple map with a name that matches the grid to have a thumbnail for the grid. 
            </p>
